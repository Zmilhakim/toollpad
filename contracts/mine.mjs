// Finds the CREATE2 salt that puts the toll hook on an address the pool manager
// will actually call. Sends nothing, needs no key.
//
// A v4 pool reads a hook's permissions out of the low 14 bits of its address, so
// the hook cannot be deployed wherever it happens to land. The factory deploys
// it with CREATE2 in its own constructor, which means the salt has to be mined
// against an address the factory does not have yet — its own. That address is a
// hash of the deployer and its next nonce, so it can be worked out in advance,
// and this is where that is done.
//
// `deploy.mjs` runs this same code. Running it separately is for seeing the
// answer before spending anything on it.
