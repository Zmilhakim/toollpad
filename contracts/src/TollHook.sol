/// @title TollHook
/// @notice The toll gate. One hook, every Toollpad pool, one rate: **5% of
/// everything paid into the pool**, in either direction. Buy with ETH and the
/// toll is 5% of the ETH. Sell the token back and it is 5% of the token. The
/// split is fixed here and cannot be changed: 80% to whoever launched that
/// token, 20% to the treasury.
///
/// There is no other fee. Toollpad pools are opened with an LP fee of zero, so
/// the toll is the entire fee schedule — nothing accrues to a position nobody
/// can withdraw from, and there is no second number to read.
///
/// ## Why the toll is charged on the way in
///
/// It costs a trader the same either way, but it decides what the creator earns.
/// Charging the input means a buy pays its toll in ETH; charging the output
/// would pay it in the token being bought, which is the one asset the creator
/// already has no shortage of.
///
/// ## Exact input and exact output are two different calls
///
/// v4 hands a hook a *specified* and an *unspecified* currency, and which one is
/// the input depends on the direction of the swap:
///
///   * **Exact input** (`amountSpecified < 0`) — the specified currency is the
///     input. `beforeSwap` returns a positive specified delta, which the pool
///     manager subtracts from the amount that reaches the curve. The trader pays
///     exactly what they asked to pay; 95% of it is swapped.
///   * **Exact output** (`amountSpecified > 0`) — the specified currency is the
///     output, and the input is only known once the curve has run. So the toll
///     is charged in `afterSwap`, whose return lands on the unspecified currency
///     — the input. It is added on top of what the swap cost, at 5/95 of it, so
///     the toll is still 5% of everything the trader pays in.
///
/// ## The toll is banked as a claim, not taken as cash
///
/// `take` would move real assets out of the pool manager at a point in the swap
/// where the trader has not paid yet — on a young pool with no ETH in it, a buy
/// would revert. So the hook `mint`s ERC-6909 claims against the pool manager
/// instead: no asset moves, the trader settles as normal, and the claim is
/// redeemed for the real thing in `withdraw`, in a transaction of its own.
///
/// ## What this contract cannot do
///
/// It cannot touch liquidity: there is no `modifyLiquidity` call in this file.
/// It cannot change the rate or the split — both are `constant`. It cannot
/// change where the money goes: `treasury` is `immutable` and a pool's creator
/// is written once, by the factory, in the launch transaction. And it pays out
/// only to the caller's own ledger entry, so no argument anyone passes can aim
/// it at somebody else's money.
