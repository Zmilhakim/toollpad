/// no way to give any of it back.
///
/// The whole surface is two functions: one the factory calls once per launch to
/// put a supply in, and the pool manager's callback that does it. There is no
/// withdraw, no owner, no emergency, and no upgrade. **Search this file: every
/// liquidity delta in it is zero or positive.** Liquidity leaves a v4 pool
/// through exactly one door — a `modifyLiquidity` with a negative delta — and
/// there is no such call here.
///
/// A v4 position is not an NFT. It is a row in the pool manager keyed by the
/// address that added it, which is this contract. So there is nothing to
/// transfer, sell, borrow against, or approve away by mistake: the position is
/// not an object that exists outside the pool manager at all.
///
/// One locker holds every launch. Positions are keyed per pool, so two launches
/// can never reach each other's liquidity, and a launch costs one contract
/// deployment less.
///
/// There is nothing to collect here either. Tollpad pools are opened with an LP
/// fee of zero — the 5% toll in `TollHook` is the entire fee schedule — so this
/// contract never accrues fees that would then need a way out.
